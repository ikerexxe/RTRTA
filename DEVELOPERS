The following instructions explain how to start developing this project in Android using Eclipse. The first thing to do is to clone this repository. Once this is done you can open Eclipse and add the project, File->New->Other->Android->Android Project from Existing Code. From the main folder go to src (RTRTA/src), select both projects (RTRTA and RTRTA-CordovaLib) and click on Finish. The first project is the RTRTA main project and the second one is a library which is necessary to run the application on Android. Now you should be able to start developing.
